# Adapting the Sports workbook

This guide lives in `Guide/Workbook.md` under the configured Sports notes folder
in your vault. Existing guide edits are preserved on template download and sync.

Give this guide and a copy of `templates/Training-example.xlsx` to your chatbot.
The example is a fixed starting point, not a personalized recommendation. Adapt
its goals, exercises, prescriptions, schedule and training volume to your needs.
Work on a copy. The plugin reads the workbook and never writes training results
back to it.

## Color key

| Color | Meaning | How to use it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pale blue | IDs and matching keys | Keep stable once training is recorded. |
| Amber | Planning inputs | Adapt goals, prescriptions, times and budgets. |
| Pale green | Recorded training | Enter actual minutes, status, results and notes. |
| Light gray | Formula output | Preserve formulas and their references. |
| Dark blue | Column headings | Preserve exact spelling and capitalization. |

Colors are cues, not access restrictions. `Strategy!E3` is an amber editable
start-date anchor; dependent dates are gray.

## Keep the workbook contract

- Save as `.xlsx`, under 5 MB. Do not add macros or external workbook links.
- Keep the tabs **Strategy**, **Recurring**, **Daily**. In Sports settings select
  **Strategy** as the strategy sheet and **Daily** as the tracking sheet.
  Select **Recurring** as the weekly schedule sheet. Each mapping accepts an exact
  tab name; leave a mapping blank to disable that import. Older workbooks with **Training log** remain supported.
- Keep section names alone in column A. Put their exact headers on the next row.
  A section name alone in column A begins the next table. Do not insert blank
  rows inside a Strategy table; they end that table.
- Do not put decorative titles, legends or commentary inside the data tables.
  Extra Daily columns must follow the supported names below.
- Keep identifiers unique and nonempty. Use simple IDs such as `pull-strength`.
  Preserve references when changing IDs in a new, unrecorded plan.
- Use real dates formatted `yyyy-mm-dd`, or explicit `YYYY-MM-DD` text. Use
  nonnegative numbers for minutes. Blank means unrecorded, not zero.
- Keep formulas and save calculated results. A chatbot that writes formulas must
  also calculate and save their cached values using a spreadsheet engine before
  handing the file back. The plugin reads saved values, not formula expressions.

## Strategy

Keep the following sections and headers:

| Section | Headers |
| --- | --- |
| Plan | `schema_version`, `plan_id`, `plan_name`, `timezone`, `start_date` |
| Goals | `goal_id`, `title`, `benchmark`, `baseline`, `test`, `category`, `result_column`, `garmin_types` |
| Parts | `part_id`, `version`, `title`, `prescription`, `goal_ids` |
| Week plans | `Week`, `Start`, `Phase`, `Focus`, `Targets`, `Advance when`, `Minutes`, `A`, `B` |
| Exercise arsenal | `Group`, `Exercise` |

**Plan:** exactly one row. Keep `schema_version` equal to `1`. Use a valid IANA
timezone, such as `Europe/Berlin`. Choose a stable `plan_id`; switching an imported
plan ID requires clearing the cached plan. `start_date` stays at **E3**. Set a
Monday before recording history. Plugin-created workbooks start next Monday in
the user's local calendar and use the user's local timezone.

**Goals:** use `milestone` for skills to achieve or `maintenance` for abilities to
maintain. Baselines and results must reflect actual information; do not invent
measurements or achievements.

Each goal creates a note at `Goals/<goal_id>.md` under the configured Sports notes
folder. Keep the ID stable so reviews stay attached when renaming a goal. The
review area is outside the generated section and is preserved on every sync.

The optional `result_column` and `garmin_types` fields control two independent
sources. **Both sources work for every goal, regardless of its category.**

- `result_column`: the exact tracking-sheet column name, such as `HSPU result`.
  It must end with ` result`. Only nonempty entries in that column are copied to
  the goal note, with date, session status and shared session notes. Without an
  explicit mapping, the plugin matches the goal ID/title and the example's
  muscle-up, HSPU and pistol aliases when there is one unambiguous match.
- `garmin_types`: comma-separated stable Garmin activity type keys. `running`
  matches running, track/trail/indoor/treadmill running and supported run variants.
  `swimming` matches pool and open-water swimming. Other keys match exactly.
  Activity names such as German `Laufen` do not determine the match. Without an
  explicit mapping, goals named/identified as running or swimming are detected.
  Custom goals should use explicit type keys to avoid guessing from goal prose.
- A running aspiration can have `Running result` and `running`; a swimming
  maintenance goal can have `Swimming result` and `swimming`. Adding a manual
  mapping also requires adding that exact result column to Daily.
- The template includes swimming as a maintenance goal. Its starting routine is
  reported background, not a recorded performance or a change to Recurring.

**Parts:** `part_id` and `version` together identify a training block. Daily `Block`
values refer to these IDs. In `goal_ids`, separate goal IDs with commas, for example
`muscle-up, pistol`. Each must exist in Goals. A legacy `PartGoals` table with
`part_id`, `version`, `goal_id` is also supported.

**Week plans:** use unique positive week numbers and unique Monday Start dates.
Preserve the formulas linking Start to `$E$3`. `Minutes` is the manual training
budget; recurring tracker activities are separate. `A` and `B` contain the weekly
block prescriptions and feed Daily Plan formulas. Changing block names or adding
other block columns requires adapting the Daily formulas as well. The plugin
currently imports A and B as weekly prescriptions. Keep a full description in
Parts and Daily Plan for any other blocks.

**Exercise arsenal:** one exercise per row, unique across the arsenal. Repeat the
group on each row, or leave Group blank to inherit the preceding group. Start
with a nonempty group. **Never put a comma or colon in an exercise name.** These
characters separate items and prescriptions in the example's block text.
Use `High pull (chest-to-bar intent)`, not `High pull, chest-to-bar`.
Keep dosage outside the arsenal name: write `Pike push-up` here and
`Pike push-up: 3 x 5` in the weekly block. Commas are allowed between exercises
in block prescriptions, and are required as separators in `goal_ids`.
The arsenal is imported as reference information; it does not automatically
rewrite or validate the free-text prescriptions. Update matching text yourself.
The legacy `Exercises` table is not supported.

## Recurring

Keep `Weekly schedule` in A1 and these headers in row 2:

`Day`, `Time Start`, `Time End`, `Minutes`, `Activity`, `Recorded by`, `Notes`.

Use English weekday names. Additional rows can repeat the day or leave it blank
to inherit the preceding day. A blank Activity creates no event; blank spare rows
are allowed. Use native spreadsheet times formatted `hh:mm`, or `HH:mm` text.
With text times, replace the duration formula with a positive numeric duration.
The example's formula uses native times, leaves incomplete times blank, and
supports overnight activities. Equal start/end times produce zero and must be
corrected for an activity. Keep duration positive or blank; missing cached duration
can be derived from valid start/end times during import.

Recurring activities are planned events, not completed sessions. They appear in
the strategy note; enable **Show regular activities** for the dashboard and weekly
notes. Keep the weekly schedule in Recurring only. For legacy workbooks with a `Weekly schedule` section in Strategy, select
**Strategy** as the weekly schedule sheet as well. Only the selected schedule is imported.

## Daily

Keep these headers exactly, once each, on the first nonempty row:

`Date`, `Block`, `Plan`, `Title`, `Planned minutes`, `Actual minutes`, `Status`,
`Muscle-up result`, `HSPU result`, `Pistol result`, `Notes`.

- One row represents one manual session. Keep Date and Plan formulas connected
  to the correct week and block. Copying a row requires checking every reference.
- Block must match a Parts `part_id`. Use `Part version` if that ID has multiple
  versions. Blank or `empty` Block means no linked strategy part.
- Status is one of `planned`, `in-progress`, `completed`, `skipped`, `cancelled`.
  Set `completed` explicitly only after doing the session.
- Leave actual minutes and results blank until recorded. A result alone does not
  mark the session completed. Without Status, recorded results imply in-progress.
- Result columns may be renamed or added, but must end with ` result`.
  Optional completion columns must end with ` done` and contain TRUE, FALSE,
  or blank. FALSE and blank are different; neither claims completion.
- Other supported optional headers are `Session ID`, `Part version`, `Sport`.
  Do not add arbitrary columns such as `Reps` or `Weight`; use `Reps result`
  or `Weight result` instead.
- Without Session ID, the plugin uses Date plus Block as the session identity.
  For two sessions with the same date and block, add distinct stable Session IDs.

## Protect recorded history

Never shift the start date, change session identity, or rewrite completed training
when adapting future weeks. Preserve completed rows, dates, IDs, results and part
versions. If a part has completed history, preserve that part definition and add a
new version for future sessions. Keep the old version and select versions in Daily.
The plugin rejects changes to linked part definitions and dates it can recognize
as completed history, and retains missing completed sessions. Stable explicit
Session IDs make those checks more reliable.

Write reflections outside generated sections in Obsidian. Sync protects those
sections against accidental edits; change plans in the workbook instead.

## Checklist for a chatbot

1. Read this guide. Ask for the user's goals, availability and known baselines.
2. Adapt a copy of the example; preserve headers, sections, IDs and formulas.
3. Update goal links, arsenal names, weekly prescriptions and Daily consistently.
4. Preserve recorded history; leave future actuals and results blank.
5. Recalculate and save the XLSX. Check for formula errors, broken references,
   duplicate IDs, unknown blocks/goals and commas or colons in arsenal names.
6. In Obsidian, select the file and sheet names, then **Sync now**. Confirm the
   imported dates, prescriptions and recurring durations before relying on them.
